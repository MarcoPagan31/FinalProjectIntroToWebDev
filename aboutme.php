        Hi, my name is Marco Pagan. I have been programming ever since my first programming class in 2014.
        I am pursuing a Computing and Informatics Degree at Rowan University. The anticipated graduation date is December of 2020.
        I have worked on several projects throughout my educational career with several programming languages  
        such as Java, C++, Swift, etc.
    <br>
    </br>
        Ever since my first internship in 2020 at CHOP, I have been heavily
        involved in website development. It was an amazing experience working the
        type of team I worked with on a day to day basis at CHOP.  
    <br>
    </br>
        I hope to attain at least one or more internships so that I can 
        gain more experience in this field. I aspire to attain a website development or software engineering position in the near future.
