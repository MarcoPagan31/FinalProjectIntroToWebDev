      <h3>CHOP Biorepository Portal Admin Feature</h3>
      <p id="demotext">
      A backend admin feature built with Django on the Biorepository Portal, 
      a biobank system used to collect information on patients diseases. 
      If a user is aligned with multiple protocols, when their nautilus credentials need to be updated, a BRP administrator needs to update each instance of their nautilus credentials. 
      I simplified this process to input nautilus credentials for a single user once, and all instances of that user's nautilus credentials will all be updated at once.</p>
    <ul id="CHOPlist">
      <li>
          Coded in Django for both the front-end and the back-end of the admin feature. 
          Used PostgreSQL for database.
      </li>
      <li>
          Learned Docker and how to dockerize a file, and Git since GitHub was the main open-source platform DBHI used.
      </li>
      <li>
          Developed documents based on the stages of software development.

    <h3>Instagram Clone</h3>
    <p id="demotext">
        A replica of instagram's front-end. Used React JS, well-known JavaScript library, to display the interface.
        Used Firebase as a back-end. Google Firebase is a Google-backed application development software that enables developers to develop iOS, Android and Web apps. 
        Instagram's API was also used in this project to fetch the data. 
    </p>
    <ul id="IGlist">
      <li>
          Used React hooks and state: useState and useEffect.
      </li>
      <li>
          Props and components utilized throughout the entire project to save memory. This also makes the project load 
          faster.
      </li>
      <li>
          Everytime a new post is added to the database, the app snapshots the new data immediately into  
          the app.
